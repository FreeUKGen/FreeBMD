# FreeBMD
All tasks relating to FreeBMD, BMD2 and related software. An open-source genealogy record database and search engine. 
We would love you to contribute and volunteer some of your time if you want to get involved! :) If you would like to help with our project/s, please take a look at the site (https://www.freebmd.org.uk/) and at the tasks here. Perhaps try and replicate a few bugs (if we have any) and suggest a few potential solutions.
